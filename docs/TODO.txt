Documentation to write:

* clean up the getting started page (should go from zero to making a change and submitting a PR, including creating a new universe)
* architecture
* anatomy of a build / IAD / OAD
* runPackage versus runArtifact
* code review options
* merge driver
* pins
* third party
* using eclipse
* optioanl settings (logging, artifact caching, pin remotes, etc)
* document TODOs
** eclipsegen (intellij, others?)
** figure out how to build c/c++/ruby/python/go
** figure out better CR options
** import third party packages
** think about having qbt delegate to `runArtifact qbt` so we always get the newest qbt
