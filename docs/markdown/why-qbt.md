# QBT - Why QBT?

QBT is a framework you can use to manage a set of consistent versions of many
interconnected software projects, and make changes to those projects while
ensuring none of them break.  QBT is just a tool which can manage dependencies
and stitch together many repositories.  When used correctly, however, it
enables reproducibility, consistency, change management, and trust/auditing.

QBT is the first open-source build tool targeted at usecases the likes of which
have previously only been served in large enterprises like Amazon, Facebook,
and Google.
